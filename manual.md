  <h2>The Most Complicated Edition of Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
</p>

**Multi-Dimensional N-Hypercube Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe with Multi-Dimensional Multiverse Time-Travel** (which I will refer to soley as **Tech-Tac-Toe** from now on) is a variation on the game Tic-Tac-Toe, created to make a very complicated edition of this classic game. The rules are the same as normal Tic-Tac-Toe, but with these changes.

### Changes Outline:

**Tech-Tac-Toe** has these changes from its predecessor:

- The board of the game no longer is constrained by dimension and width. Depending on the configuration of the game, you can play in any amount of dimensions, with any width for the board. For reference, the normal board for Tic-Tac-Toe is a 2-D board with a width of 3, making it 3x3, or 3^2. Board sizes are written like this:

    `width^dimension`

- The game now features time-travel. When you travel into the past or future, a new timeline/universe is created, with the things that you did in that timeline being seperate from the normal time. This is represented by two initial dimensions of time: headtime, and multiverse time. Headtime is the normal variation of time, like the time in our universe. Multiverse time describes how far away a timeline is from headtime(0 in multiverse time.) Positive multiverse time contains the multiverses created by the X player, and likewise for negative multiverse time, with O player. Both players can play any legal move on each side. Here is an ASCII diagram of how this works:

`X Past | X Future`

`O Past | O Future`

- Additionally, there are **4** extra temporal (time) dimensions. On any turn, you can move in these dimensions.

- On any turn, you can also make a new timeline, as a copy from the current one.

- **Tech-Tac-Toe** also applies several concepts from quantum mechanics into itself. You can **merge** two timelines into one, using superposition to handle combining two cells. A cell can be, for example, half X, and half O. You can also remove a board from this state by either **splitting** or **collapsing**. **Splitting** splits the superposition by making new timelines to hold the different values in each cell. **Collapsing** is where a random number generator picks one state from each cell, changes the board to those states.

- Quantum entanglement is also implemented. Any player can **entangle** two cells, hiding their states. When a player decides to observe an entangled cell (by **reading** it), that cell will collapse to a random state, and, the other cell will collapse to the opposite of the **read** cell.

- Winning now requires a player to win in all universes.

### Object:

To win **Tech-Tac-Toe**, a player must get a three(or alternate width)-in-a-row of their player name (X or O) in each universe.

### Possible Moves:

- **Mark**:

    Marking is the most basic of **Tech-Tac-Toe** moves. It is where a player marks a cell of choice, at the time and timeline of choice as their player name (X or O.)

- **Branch**:

    When a player branches, they make a new timeline, copying the current one they are on.

- **Timeline Merge**:

    All players have the ability to merge two seperate timelines on the multiverse axis. Each of the corresponding cells from each timeline will combine into one. Keep in mind that two of the same cell will combine into their original form, and one empty cell and a filled cell will combine into the state of the filled cell.

- **Board Merge**:

    This is basically just the timeline merge but with only one board.

- **Timeline Collapse**:

    This move will take a merged timeline, and collapse all of the superposition cells into a random part of the cell.

- **Timeline Split**:

    Splitting a timeline is the opposite of merging two of them. It removes each part of the superpositions, and puts them in seperate timelines.

- **Board Collapse & Split**:

    There are also varieties of collapsing and splitting for singular boards.

- **Entangle**:

    Entangling is where a player hides the states of two cells, and entangles them. This doesn't do much until one of the cells is observed.

- **Observe**:

    When a player observes an entangled cell, that cell will receive a random state, and the other cell will receive the opposite.
